    "The city can be a tricky place to raise a dog. Dogs need open spaces, accepting communities, pet supply and grooming locations, and plenty of dog-friendly establishments and eateries. Thatâ€™s why dog owners are always looking for the perfect neighborhood to raise their pup, and it can be challenging to find. San Francisco is one of the more dog-welcoming cities, but what is the perfect area in San Francisco for a dog owner? My analysis will find a solution to this question, by identifying the top dog-friendly neighborhoods to live in San Francisco."

    "I will be using Foursquare location data to find the neighborhoods that provide the most extensive list of top dog related establishments - for example, I will be searching on dog parks, pet stores, pet grooming services, dog daycares, and so on. I will also look for non-dog related institutions, such as restaurants, cafes, and public spaces, that welcome dogs. For example, a possible way to look into this would be looking for key words in comments that would indicate a dog-friendly location. I will then rate the neighborhoods based on the highest number of top-rated dog-friendly fixtures. The Foursquare location data is available through the Foursquare website - [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/)."
